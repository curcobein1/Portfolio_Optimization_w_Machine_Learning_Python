# Portfolio_Optimization_w_Machine_Learning_Python

This project explores the area of portfolio optimization strategies by combining traditional financial theory with modern machine learning techniques. The goal is to compare how classical methods like the Markowitz Model perform against forward-looking forecasts generated by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

About the Project

The analysis is based on 10 selected stocks from the BIST 30 index between 2020 and june 2025. The project proceeds in three phases:

1. Exploratory Analysis & Classical Optimization  
   Using the Markowitz Mean-Variance model to build a portfolio based on historical returns.

2. LSTM-Based Price Forecasting  
   Forecasting the stock prices of the next 30 days using a single LSTM model trained on all stocks simultaneously. Instead of building a separate model for each stock, all stock price sequences were combined into one training set, enabling a more general and lightweight forecasting approach.

3. Traditional & LSTM Portfolio Comparison   
   Using the previous LSTM-predicted returns to create a forward-looking portfolio and comparing it against the first classical one.
